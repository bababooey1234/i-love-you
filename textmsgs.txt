I love you more than anything else in this world
I feel incredibly safe with you
You are the most kind, supportive person, friend, and partner that I know
I am so excited to spend the rest of our lives together
You constantly provide me with more happiness than I could've ever dreamed of just a couple months ago
You and I are going to make the most wonderful happy bundles of joy together
Your beauty is so immense it floors me every time I see you
I feel the most myself when I'm by your side. We complement each other so perfectly; everything just clicks when I'm with you
I promise to make our life together as joyous and wonderful as you deserve
Sometimes you make me blush even when we're not talking, I just think about you and how amazing you are and how much I love you and blush go brrrrrr
Your presence is perfect safety in my life
I know for sure that everything's gonna be okay when we're together
I can't wait for us both to achieve so much in our full, happy lives
Hey sweetie, are you Broca's aphasia? Because you leave me speechless.
Some day our little babies are gonna get to have their first times of everything - first steps, first words, first days at school. God I just can't wait to watch them grow up with us as their parents
I love you more than Mr Davis loves ducks
I love you more than I love videos of small babies laughing cause you're my little baby and your laugh is everything to me
