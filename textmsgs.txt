I love you more than anything else in this world
I feel incredibly safe with you
You are the most kind, supportive person, friend, and partner that I know
I am so excited to spend the rest of our lives together
You constantly provide me with more happiness than I could've ever dreamed of just a couple months ago
You and I are going to make the most wonderful happy bundles of joy together
Your beauty is so immense it floors me every time I see you
I feel the most myself when I'm by your side. We complement each other so perfectly; everything just clicks when I'm with you
I promise to make our life together as joyous and wonderful as you deserve
Sometimes you make me blush even when we're not talking, I just think about you and how amazing you are and how much I love you and blush go brrrrrr
